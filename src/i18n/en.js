    quote: 'Each chant has its owner, an enchanted one. each enchanted one, like \'pankararé\', \'dandaruré\’, have a praiá (a guardian spirit) and each have 25 chants, what you call ‘music’. They come from nature and the teaching at night through our dream, so they stay in our memory.',

    <p>The anthropological artistic project "Voz da Terra" (The voice from the ground) develops electronic sound artefacts that enable the listening, amplification and production of memory together with the indigenous culture of Brazil. This artefact is co-created with native Brazilians from northeast, and it mixes the ancestral tradition with digital technologies of communication and storage of information. The techno-indigenous device consists of a mini-computer (raspberry pi) lodged inside the pot of ceramics made by the indigenous community, that has the ability to record store and reproduce the sound that are made inside of it.  
    With this pot, the indigenous community can then record share their oral culture that is passed down generation to generation, their traditional chants and songs, poems, stories, their political demands and messages, in a way that it strength their culture and the memory of it. The material gather by the device is then uploaded to a web server where it can be accessed online, in a way to salvage and amplify the memories and cultural heritage of their culture.</p>
